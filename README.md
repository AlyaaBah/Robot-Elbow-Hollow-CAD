# Robot-Elbow-Hollow-CAD

A mechanical elbow joint component designed in Onshape as part of a custom robotic arm system. This parametric CAD model demonstrates hollow-based geometry, symmetry, and spatial optimization for robotics.

## Overview

This project presents a CAD-modeled elbow segment designed for robotic articulation. The model features a cylindrical base and a rectangular upper section with symmetrical cutouts, created to support rotational movement and modular assembly between robotic arm segments.

The component is built within Onshape using multi-body design principles to ensure compatibility with servo-driven joints and mechanical feedback systems.

## Components

- **Cylindrical base** for stable mounting and rotation  
- **Hollow rectangular upper section** for linkage accommodation  
- **Twin top cutouts** for sensor or actuator integration  
- **Smooth edges** for stress management and aesthetic coherence  
- **Modeled as a unified part** with clean constraints  

## CAD Workflow

- Reference plane alignment with Front, Top, and Right views  
- Origin-based sketching and dimensional precision  
- Extrusions shaped for mounting and support features  
- Cut removal for top openings and internal hollow section  
- Geometric constraints applied to ensure symmetry  

## Assembly Integration

An assembly was created in Onshape to demonstrate the interaction between the elbow component and other mechanical parts. This assembly includes:

- **Three distinct parts**: the original elbow component and two complementary mechanical segments  
- **Mate features** such as *Planar*, *Cylindrical*, and *Group* constraints to simulate realistic mechanical behavior  
- **Spatial alignment and motion planning** to validate the elbow’s role in a modular robotic system  
- **Hierarchical structure** that reflects real-world joint articulation and component dependency  

This assembly serves as a proof-of-concept for how the elbow part integrates into a larger robotic framework, supporting both static and dynamic analysis.

## Challenges Faced

**Defining cutout positions without interfering geometry**  
*Solution:* Used construction planes to establish precise boundaries, then mirrored cutouts for alignment.

**Maintaining structural integrity in hollow design**  
*Solution:* Adjusted wall thickness and evaluated stress points to balance form and strength.

**Visualizing internal geometry during editing**  
*Solution:* Enabled section view and transparency toggles for internal inspection.

**Ensuring mate accuracy in assembly**  
*Solution:* Applied precise constraints and verified alignment through exploded views and motion simulation.

## Applications

- Elbow joint component for articulated arm movement  
- Component in educational robotics and design kits  
- Prototype base for servo integration and hinge development  
- CAD simulation module for testing mechanical behavior  
- Assembly-level validation for modular robotic systems  

## Future Improvements

- Add rotational shaft alignment guides  
- Create slots for servo brackets and hardware mounting  
- Enable motion analysis in Onshape using mate connectors  
- Export STL files for print-ready formats and real-world testing  
- Expand assembly with dynamic joints and sensor modules
